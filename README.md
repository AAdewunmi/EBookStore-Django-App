## 1. Project Title:

Book Store E Commerce App

## 2. Tech Stack: 

- Python
- Django
- SQL
- Stripe Payments API


----

- Notes:


1. Project Refactor (Section 9): You should start implementing the e commerce application project by working through section 9, first. You will thank me, later. ðŸ˜Ž


    I've worked through sections 1 to 8 but have not refactored the project par Section 9.


2. Stripe and Paypal Payment API: Stripe and PayPal payment module's have been coded up (separately) and individual SDK's installed. However, you will have to generate your own API keys for both modules!
