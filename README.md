## 6: Product Backlog:

1. Project Refactor (Section 9): I've worked through sections 1 to 8 but have not refactored the project par Section 9. **You should start implementing the e commerce application project by working through section 9, first. You will thank me, later.** ðŸ˜Ž


2. Stripe and Paypal Payment API: Stripe and PayPal payment module's have been coded up (separately) and individual SDK's installed. However, you will have to generate your own API keys for both modules.

3. Pytest Testing including Factory Boy (Section 10): I did not implement test classes. You are free to do so using the accompaning video on Youtube!
